Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 3x3x3 boxes
Solvent box contains 13314 atoms in 4438 residues
Removed 2241 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 27 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
    SOL (   3 atoms):  3682 residues
Generated solvent containing 11046 atoms in 3682 residues
Writing generated configuration to ET3A_D2O.gro

Output configuration contains 11067 atoms in 3683 residues
Volume                 :      111.21 (nm^3)
Density                :     992.995 (g/l)
Number of solvent molecules:   3682   

Processing topology

Back Off! I just backed up temp_topol.top to ./#temp_topol.top.1#

GROMACS reminds you: "They're Red Hot" (Red Hot Chili Peppers)

Adding line for 3682 solvent molecules with resname (SOL) to topology file (temp_topol.top)
