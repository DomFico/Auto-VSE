Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 3x3x3 boxes
Solvent box contains 11238 atoms in 3746 residues
Removed 2241 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 12 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
    SOL (   3 atoms):  2995 residues
Generated solvent containing 8985 atoms in 2995 residues
Writing generated configuration to NNDMA_H2O.gro

Output configuration contains 9000 atoms in 2996 residues
Volume                 :      92.581 (nm^3)
Density                :     969.342 (g/l)
Number of solvent molecules:   2995   

Processing topology

Back Off! I just backed up temp_topol.top to ./#temp_topol.top.1#

GROMACS reminds you: "She Says She Can't Go Home Without a Chaperone" (E. Costello)

Adding line for 2995 solvent molecules with resname (SOL) to topology file (temp_topol.top)
