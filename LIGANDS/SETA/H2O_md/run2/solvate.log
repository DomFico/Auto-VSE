Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 3x3x3 boxes
Solvent box contains 12267 atoms in 4089 residues
Removed 2268 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 18 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
    SOL (   3 atoms):  3327 residues
Generated solvent containing 9981 atoms in 3327 residues
Writing generated configuration to SETA_H2O.gro

Output configuration contains 9995 atoms in 3328 residues
Volume                 :     102.854 (nm^3)
Density                :     969.341 (g/l)
Number of solvent molecules:   3327   

Processing topology

Back Off! I just backed up temp_topol.top to ./#temp_topol.top.1#

GROMACS reminds you: "We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something and that this thing must be attained." (Marie Curie)

Adding line for 3327 solvent molecules with resname (SOL) to topology file (temp_topol.top)
