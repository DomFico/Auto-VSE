Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 3x3x3 boxes
Solvent box contains 16200 atoms in 5400 residues
Removed 2889 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 39 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
    SOL (   3 atoms):  4424 residues
Generated solvent containing 13272 atoms in 4424 residues
Writing generated configuration to E4TPB_H2O.gro

Output configuration contains 13299 atoms in 4425 residues
Volume                 :     135.815 (nm^3)
Density                :     976.876 (g/l)
Number of solvent molecules:   4424   

Processing topology

Back Off! I just backed up temp_topol.top to ./#temp_topol.top.1#

GROMACS reminds you: "We're having an information explosion, among others, and it's certainly obvious that information is of no use unless it's available." (Sister Mary Kenneth Keller)

Adding line for 4424 solvent molecules with resname (SOL) to topology file (temp_topol.top)
